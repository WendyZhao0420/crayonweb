        <h1>Crayon Shin-chan</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>Crayon Shin-chan is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. Crayon Shin-chan made its first appearance in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009. A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team, titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).</p>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/seiyuwiki/images/1/17/Crayon_Shin-chan.png/"/>
        <P>An animated television adaptation began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing, with over 1000 episodes. The show has been dubbed in 30 languages which aired in 45 countries. As of 2023, both the Crayon Shin-Chan and New Crayon Shin-Chan series has over 148 million copies in circulation, making it among the best-selling manga series in history.</p>
        
        <h2 style = "clear:both">Fictional Main Characters </h2>
        <div class = "shin">
        <li>Shinnosuke Nohara</li>
        <p>Is the titular main protagonist of Crayon Shin-chan. He is the son of Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is "Shin-chan" and he is Himawari's older    brother. A kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series.</p>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/6/6d/SHIN.png"/>   
        <p>He is five years old and yet acts overly mature. He knows the adults' words (does not always fully understand the meaning though), and hints at his somewhat deep philosophy in between dumb behavior. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others). Unlike his relatives and friends, he's known to smile and laugh sideways which his sister also does.</p>
            
        <p>In several occasions, both in manga and anime, he is either seen doing drag or wearing animal costumes. There have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Sometimes he can be very kind to those around him. For example, the dog that he has, Shiro, is one that he saved on the street. In one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, becoming wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's anger since it was his last set of clean clothes. In another episode, he gives Masao the change in cash-money he has even though he knows that his mother will scold him later. However, these are often immediately followed by his weird antics.</p>
            
        <p>A running gag in the series involves Shin-chan being late for the bus to his school, usually due to taking a long time in the bathroom, leading Misae to begrudgingly having to take him to school on her bike. Although he always teases his mother, he is very close to her. There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others, and in a few rare instances he shows that deep down he really does care for his family even though he doesn't act like it.</p>

        <div class = "mom"> 
        <li>Misae Nohara</li>
        <img src ="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/55/74/fb/5574fb39d75465386b69a5abbece3f78.jpg"/>
        <P>Is the mother of the Nohara family, and its caretaker. She is 29 years old but she always tells people that she is 24 or 25. She is the classical housewife of post-war Japan - she cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers and lazes all to varying degrees of success. </P>
        <p>While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself. She always changes her hair style, as seen it is sometimes curly and sometimes long and shattered hair. She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week. For example, she is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money . However, she buys in extreme quantities, which seems to defeat the purpose. Both Shin-Chan and Himawari resemble their mother.</p>
    </div>
        
        <div class = "Toru"> 
        <li>Toru Kazama </li>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/d/d1/Kazama.png/"/>
        <p> Is Shinchan's immaculately groomed friend and classmate from the sunflower class, who usually loses his mind when Shinnosuke teases him and other things. He also bickers with Shinchan. Even though Kazama always denied when Shin says that he is his best friend, his best friend is Shinchan too. Of all Shin's friends, he's the only one referred to by his family name (Kazama-kun). Only his mother and father use his given name (Tōru-chan).</p>
        <p>He is active in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juku">'juku' </a>and English cram school. He often acts like a know-it-all,which makes him look somewhat snobbish. Juku takes precedence over play for Kazama-kun. He has an affection for anime and manga girls especially magical girls such as Magical Girl Moe-P, he has a crush on many girls like Ai, Midori, Hanako and Torma and he fell madly in love with Ai and asked if she will marry him after which he is tightly slapped by Ai which he tries to hide from his friends. He also has a strong attachment to his mother. His father lives abroad. A recurring theme in the show is that he tries to hang out with upper class kids his age to be a part of the "elite", but runs across Shinchan being weird with him which ultimately causes them to lose interest in hanging out with him. His strengths are English, calligraphy, sports (football and baseball) and math. He is a member of the Kasukabe Defense Organization. </p>

        <div class = "dad"> 
        <li>Hiroshi Nohara</li>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/b/bd/DK-8.jpg/"/>
        <p> Is the father of the Nohara family, and its sole source of income as he works at as kakarichô (a low-level manager) at Futaba Shoji where he does overtime to earn a little more money and because of the 32-year mortgage he still has to pay. </p>
        <p>He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family breadwinner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. He is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take-home pay to his wife every month. He is a quiet, reasonable person who is almost always invited by his boss or a worker to drink beers - where he almost always gets drunk.</p>
    </div>
        <div class = "sato"> 
        <li>Masao Sato</li>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/e/ec/Masao.png/"/>
        <p>Is one of Shin-chan's friends and classmates from the sunflower class. Sometimes he is called 'Masao-kun'. He is a weak, sensitive boy and is scared of many things. He can be easily embarrassed, but believes his and Ai's love can conquer anything. He has been in love with Megumi Yamura.</P>
        <P>His nickname is "Onigiri" due to his shaven head's resemblance to a rice ball and there are several moments where Shin-chan accidentally mistook Masao's gray colored head for a rice ball and even tried to eat it. His friends use the nickname as a term of endearment, while the people that bully him use it as a put-down. Shinchan and Nene often calls him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri">'Onigiri"</a>. </p>
        <P>Masao likes to collect phone cards and insects and even gave some crickets to Shin. He also likes the manga of Usuto Yoshii and his hobby is to write manga. He is a good boy at home and likes to maintain cleanliness as shown when he "cleans the mess in Shin-chan's house".</P>
    </div>
        <div class = "nene"> 
        <li>Nene Sakurada</li>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/4/40/Pennt.png/"/>
        <p> Is one of Shin-chan's classmates and friends from the sunflower class. She is five years old.She loves to play "real omamagoto" in which divorces and arguments are very common and she typically forces/blackmails the boys to play with her. She insists on being the mom all the time-and she forces her friends to do stuff they don't really want to do. This is always a nuisance to Shin-chan, Bo-chan, and Kazama-kun and a nightmare to Masao as he often needs to be Nene's husband (as an unsuccessful salaryman) in the plot. She occasionally sees her mother go crazy or do something out of character which shrieks Nene to say something literally translated to be "you're not my usual mom!".</p>
        <P>Nene styles herself as a sweet girl, but in fact she has inherited her mother's temper and is quite bossy. Like her mother , she hits a stuffed bunny to relieve her anger. Alternatively, Nene uses Masao as the lightning rod for her frustration when her bunny is not available. She considers Ai Suotome her rival and can't stand it when boys prefer Ai-chan to her. She has many pet cats which she loves a lot and she likes to watch the TV Magical Girl Moe-P. She is a member of the Kasukabe Defense Organization.</P>
    </div>
        <div class = "bo"> 
        <li>Bo-chan</li>
        <img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/5/5f/Bo.png/"/>
        <P> Is one of Shin-chan's friends and classmates from the sunflower class, he is 5 years old.He seems slow and expressionless, but is actually quite smart and has an interest in artistic, adult-oriented things. He loves to collect various kinds of stones, and investigating urban legends and various mysterious objects such as UFOs. He has his own place where he says the rarest stones in Japan can be found. He often surprises his friends with his insight, though he speaks quite slowly. He always has a trail of mucus running down his nose and can perform various tricks with it. Bô-chan always volunteers for the role of pet dog  or cat  when the group plays house. After the nursery he likes to go to a Kasukabe store in which tatami is made, he loves to see how they do it.</P>
        <P>He is a functionally slow-speaking boy who is passionate about oddly shaped rocks. Like his interests, he's very odd and mysterious, </P>
